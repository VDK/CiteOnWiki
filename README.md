A Chrome extension that makes a few sites a little better

NagFree is a Chrome extension that takes away the usability problems some sites have. Flickr and Instagram, for example, don't allow you to right-click on photographs to save them. This extension fixes that. The search results page on Wikimedia Commons is pretty awful, so this extension fixes that. Note that nagfree *is not* an adblocker, it just blocks annoying behaviour some sites have.
